--------------------------------------                 STEPS INVOLVED IN MAKING OF THE PROJECT            ---------------------------------------------

1. AWS (S3 Bucket): The retailer utilized Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 bucket to store the raw data securely.
                    It involved dumping the dataset into the S3 bucket and defining roles and policies to ensure proper access control.

2. Snowflake (SQL): Snowflake, a cloud-based data warehousing platform, was utilized to create tables,
                    automate data ingestion from the S3 bucket using stored procedures & tasks, and generate key performance indicators (KPIs) for the analysis.
                    Then Connecting Jupyter notebook with snowflake for data cleaning and performing EDA.

3. Python: Python is a versatile programming language commonly used in data analysis. It was employed for all data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
           tasks in this case study & automating the EDA using Jupyter Lab. after that sending the clean data back to snowflake for KPI making part.

4. Power BI & DAX: Connecting the clean tables from SNOWFLAKE to Power BI - a powerful business intelligence tool, along with the Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) language,was employed for visualizing the data
                   and creating measures to analyze key metrics for visualisng the data using different charts, providing insights for the business
                   and Scheduling the refresh of the datasets in Power BI Service.
